### Plan:

1. **Update `lifegame.c`**:
   - **Error Handling**: Add error handling for empty files in the `initialize_world_from_file` function to ensure that the program does not crash when trying to read from an empty file.
   - **Debugging Statements**: Remove or replace debugging print statements with a proper logging mechanism to clean up the output for production use.
   - **World Initialization**: Ensure that the world is initialized correctly when loading from a file, avoiding unnecessary calls to `initialize_world`.

2. **Update `lab1b.c`**:
   - **Output Filename**: Modify the program to allow the user to specify the output filename for saving the world state instead of hardcoding it to "world.txt".
   - **Debugging Statements**: Remove or replace debugging print statements with a proper logging mechanism.

3. **Update `lab1a.c`**:
   - **Generation Loop**: Modify the generation loop to print the world state after each generation to provide better visibility into the evolution of the game.
   - **File Initialization Option**: Consider adding an option to initialize the world from a file, similar to `lab1b.c`, for consistency.

### Follow-up Steps:
- After implementing the changes, I will test the program to ensure that it functions correctly and meets the requirements.
- I will confirm with you for any additional requirements or modifications.
